## RAG Assistants

Please review [RAG Assistants information](./RAG/HowtoRAGAssistants.md).

## Playground

It allows viewing the [Frontend](https://docs.saia.ai/Frontend) and provides a practical view of how end users will interact with the artificial intelligence models defined in the backoffice. This makes it easier to understand the interaction flow and allows adjusting the configuration to achieve a more effective user experience.

## Observability
GeneXus Enterprise AI stores and tracks every request made through its API layers, providing organizations with complete visibility into the usage of assistants, AI models, and the associated cost for each request. This allows organizations to monitor and analyze resource usage, make informed decisions about resource allocation, and optimize usage for cost-efficiency. 

With clear visibility into both usage and cost, organizations can effectively manage their AI-driven workflows, control expenses, and maximize their return on investment. 

By taking advantage of these features, organizations can maintain control over their AI infrastructure, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance operational efficiency.

### Requests
In the left menu of GeneXus Enterprise AI, the "Requests" option gives you access to a comprehensive trace that provides complete observability for each request made. 

The trace allows you to easily filter requests by model, assistant, API token, datetime range, and status, enabling you to quickly identify specific requests of interest. Furthermore, by clicking on the Module column for a particular request, you can access detailed information about that request.

Within the request details, you can view the input and output data, the specific model used for the request, the associated cost, and the timestamp indicating when the request was executed. This level of detail gives you insights into the specific details of each request, facilitating the troubleshooting, analysis, and optimization of your AI workflows.

The ability to access and review the complete details of each request enables you to understand the underlying data and processes, making it easier to identify and address any issues or areas for improvement. With this comprehensive observability feature, organizations can ensure the accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of their AI-driven workflows in GeneXus Enterprise AI.

## API Tokens
API Tokens play a crucial role in executing GeneXus Enterprise AI APIs. These tokens are required to access and use the functionality provided by the APIs. 

There are two types of API Tokens: Organization API Tokens and Project API Tokens.

### Organization API Tokens
Certain operations require API Tokens with a higher scope, such as access to Project creation, updating and deletion.

Users with the necessary privileges can manage this type of API Tokens in order to work only with OrganizationAPI endpoints. These API Tokens are not intended to work at the project level and cannot be used to reference assistants or AI models.

### Project API Tokens
For each project, you can define multiple Project API Tokens. This allows for granular control and tracking of usage.

It is important to note that API Tokens have project-wide reach.

Moreover, the ability to assign API Tokens to specific projects allows for fine-grained access control, ensuring that only authorized individuals or systems can execute requests on specific projects.

With this level of granularity, organizations can effectively manage access permissions, track usage patterns, and maintain control over their projects defined within the GeneXus Enterprise AI API.

## Members
The Members option, available in the GeneXus Enterprise AI backoffice left menu, enables you to add new members to the selected project. 

Adding members allows you to give new users access to and involvement in the project's activities.

To invite a new member, follow the steps below:

1. Access the GeneXus Enterprise AI backoffice interface and log in with your organization administrator credentials.
2. Once logged in, select the project to which you want to add members.
4. Select the "Members" option offered in the left menu.
5. Press the "NEW INVITATION" button.
6. Enter the email address of the user you want to invite as a new member.
7. Click on "Invite Member" to send the mail with the invitation. 

Once the invited user enters the backoffice, they will gain access to the project.
