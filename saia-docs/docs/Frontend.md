# GeneXus Enterprise AI Frontend

The GeneXus Enterprise AI Frontend offers an experience similar to what you will find in ChatGPT or Bard, as well as an 
intuitive interface for interacting with Assistants and LLMs. Additionally, it comes with the possibility of creating your own 
prompts and also adjust settings in the User Menu in order to convey full control over your customized experience. 

The frontend screen is divided in three: 

1.	Assistants Panel and User Menu.
2.	Chat Panel.
3.	Contextual Panel.

Below is a detailed description of the steps for establishing conversations with Assistants and LLMs, together with information 
on the operation of each Panel.

## 1.	Assistants Panel and User Menu

This Panel contains:

*	In the upper part: the Assistants section.
*	In the lower part: the User Menu.

### Assistants Section

In the upper part of the Panel, there is a list of Assistants, including those defined by default and those defined by your 
organization. The default Assistants include "Search with Google", "Chat with LLMs", and "Create Images".

In this section, you may perform the following actions:

*	Generate a New Chat by selecting the Assistant with which you wish to interact, or click on “+ New chat”.

*	Create New Folders by clicking on the option available next to “+ New Chat” (whose image contains a folder and “+”).

*	Select, search for and organize Chats. Once you have created folders and chats, you may select them, make searches, and 
even organize your chats. For example, you may drag and drop your chats in the corresponding folder to keep everything
organized and accessible.  

*	Rename your conversations. This is done by clicking on the name of the chat, then selecting the pencil image, and then
editing based on your preferences. To end, you confirm the change by pressing Enter or by clicking the check mark. 

*	Delete a specific chat when you no longer need it. To do this, you must select the chat to be deleted and then click on the
Trash icon, and end by confirming with a click on the check mark. 

It is important to bear in mind that the chats history is stored in the local storage of the browser you are using; so, if 
you change your browser, you will not see the same thing. 

### User Menu

The User Menu is in the lower part of the Panel, with additional options to manage and customize your experience.
