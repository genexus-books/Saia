# What is GeneXus Enterprise AI

GeneXus Enterprise AI is an business platform designed to facilitate the implementation of AI-Assistants tailored to your specific needs and areas of expertise.

You can create AI-Assistants that can integrate and interact with your current operations, processes, systems and documents, creating new paths of innovation and productivity to explore.

One of the great benefits of using GeneXus Enterprise AI is the ability to select a Large Language Model (LLM) and later switch to another without changing your definitions. Thus, GeneXus Enterprise AI acts as a secure bridge, connecting enterprise applications to LLMs while providing a variety of tools and features to boost productivity and innovation.
