# Introduction
This section explain in detail the different API layers that are exposed to integrate in your applications.

Basically we can find three layers, the one that is in charge of communication and through which all the calls to the different assistants pass, the assistant definition and configuration layer and an accelerator layer that encapsulates common cases such as chat and search or intent based navigation.
