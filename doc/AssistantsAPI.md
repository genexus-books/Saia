## What is a REST API?

A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It is based on a set of principles that allow clients to interact with resources on a server through standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. REST APIs are widely used in web development and are particularly suited for building scalable and flexible systems.
