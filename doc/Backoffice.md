## Introduction

Welcome to GBrain backoffice. This backoffice provides organization administrators with a range of essential options to configure projects and manage key settings. In the GBrain backoffice, administrators can easily customize projects, define and test assistants, define search domains, generate API tokens, manage members, and adjust observability options. This documentation will guide you through the various features and functionalities of the GBrain backoffice.

## Projects
Projects are the core entities where various configurations and settings are defined. Within each project, administrators can define assistants, generate API tokens for API access, and manage document management functionalities. The project management feature allows administrators to seamlessly add, update, or delete projects within the organization. The following sections will guide developers on how to perform project-related operations within the GBrain backoffice, empowering them to efficiently manage projects and their associated settings.

### Adding a project
To define a new project in the GBrain backoffice, follow the steps below:

1. Access the GBrain backoffice interface and log in with your organization administrator credentials.

2. Once logged in, navigate to the "Projects" section.

3. Locate the option to create a new project and click on it.

4. In the project creation form, provide the following information:

   - Project Name: Enter a meaningful and descriptive name for the project.
   - Project Description: Briefly summarize the purpose or objective of the project.

5. After entering the necessary information, click on the "Confirm" button to save the project details.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new project in the GBrain backoffice. Now, you can proceed to configure assistants, define API tokens, and manage document management settings for this project.

Note: It is recommended to choose project names and descriptions that accurately reflect the intended purpose and scope of the project. This facilitates better organization and improves clarity for all users involved in project management.

### Set as active
You have the option to set a specific project as the active project. This feature allows you to define which project will be used as a filter for all options that require project-specific filtering. The "Set as Active" function provides the same action as changing the project selection in the header combo containing the project list.

Upon setting a project as active, all subsequent actions and filters within the GBrain backoffice will be applied specifically to that project.
